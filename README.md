AURIN/ANDS Health Demonstrator
===================


This project has been supported by the Australian National
Data Service (ANDS) and the Australian Urban Research
Infrastructure Network (AURIN). 

The purpose of developing this tool was to draw on a study of the care experiences of a number of people with diabetes from marginalised and disadvantaged backgrounds in the North and West Metropolitan Region (N&WMR) of the Victorian Department of Health. 
It attempts to make possible the integration of health and social data to identify 'hot-spots' of combined or clustered vulnerability and visually represent service location and accessibility relevant to the complex health and welfare needs of people from this locations.
